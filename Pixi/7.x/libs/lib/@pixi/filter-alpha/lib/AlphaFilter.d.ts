import { Filter } from '@pixi/core';
/**
 * Simplest filter - applies alpha.
 *
 * Use this instead of Container's alpha property to avoid visual layering of individual elements.
 * AlphaFilter applies alpha evenly across the entire display object and any opaque elements it contains.
 * If elements are not opaque, they will blend with each other anyway.
 *
 * Very handy if you want to use common features of all filters:
 *
 * 1. Assign a blendMode to this filter, blend all elements inside display object with background.
 *
 * 2. To use clipping in display coordinates, assign a filterArea to the same container that has this filter.
